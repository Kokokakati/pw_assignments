        "\n",
        "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange data.\n",
        "Example: When you use a weather app on your smartphone to check the current weather forecast, the app is likely using an API provided by a weather service provider (such as OpenWeatherMap or Weather.com) to retrieve the weather data. The app sends a request to the weather service's API, and the API responds with the requested weather information, which is then displayed in the app.\n",

        "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages:\n",
        "Promotes modularity and reusability: APIs allow developers to modularize their code and reuse existing functionality, saving time and effort.\n",
        "Encourages collaboration: APIs enable different software systems to work together, fostering collaboration among developers and organizations.\n",
        "Enhances flexibility: APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing data and services, allowing developers to adapt and integrate various components into their applications.\n",
        "Disadvantages:\n",
        "Security concerns: APIs can expose sensitive data and functionalities, making them potential targets for security threats such as unauthorized access and data breaches.\n",
        "Complexity: Working with APIs can be complex, especially when dealing with multiple APIs or integrating third-party services, leading to challenges in development and maintenance.\n",
        "Dependency: Applications relying heavily on external APIs may face issues if the API provider makes changes or experiences downtime, affecting the application's functionality and performance.\n",

        "Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Web API is an API specifically designed to be accessed over the web using HTTP protocols. It allows clients (such as web browsers or mobile apps) to interact with server-side applications and services through standardized web technologies.\n",
        "Difference:\n",
        "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a broader concept that encompasses any set of rules and protocols for interacting with software components or systems.\n",
        "A Web API specifically refers to APIs that are accessible over the web using HTTP, typically through RESTful or SOAP-based architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
        "\n",
        "REST (Representational State Transfer): It is an architectural style for designing networked applications, emphasizing simplicity, scalability, and statelessness. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, and they typically communicate using JSON or XML.\n",
        "SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): It is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. SOAP-based APIs use XML for message formatting and can operate over a variety of transport protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and more.\n",
        "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
        "Complexity: SOAP messages tend to be larger and more complex compared to RESTful messages, leading to higher bandwidth consumption and slower performance.\n",
        "Overhead: SOAP requires more processing overhead due to its extensive XML parsing and validation, making it less efficient for lightweight and high-performance applications.\n",
        "Lack of flexibility: SOAP relies on a rigid contract-based approach, making it less adaptable to changing requirements and evolving technologies compared to RESTful APIs.\n",
