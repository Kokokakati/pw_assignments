When you make a GET request, you are asking the server to send you some data, typically to be displayed on a web page. It is used for operations that are idempotent, meaning they don't have any side effects on the server. For example, retrieving a list of items from a database.\n",

When you make a POST request, you are sending data to the server, typically to be stored in a database or processed in some way. It is used for operations that are not idempotent, meaning they may have side effects on the server. For example, submitting a form with user data.\n",
