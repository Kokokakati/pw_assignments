        "It works by defining a grid of hyperparameters to explore. For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, the model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation to estimate its performance. The combination that results in the highest evaluation metric, such as accuracy or F1 score, is selected as the optimal set of hyperparameters.\n",
