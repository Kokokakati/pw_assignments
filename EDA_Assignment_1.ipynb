        "\n",
        "The wine quality dataset typically consists of features related to various chemical properties of wine, which are important in predicting the quality of wine. Some key features and their importance are:\n",
        "Fixed Acidity: The fixed acidity of wine affects its taste and is essential for overall flavor.\n",
        "Volatile Acidity: High volatile acidity can lead to an unpleasant vinegar-like taste.\n",
        "Citric Acid: Citric acid can add a refreshing tartness and is often desired in wine.\n",
        "Residual Sugar: Residual sugar contributes to the sweetness of wine and can balance acidity.\n",
        "Chlorides: Chloride levels can affect wine's taste and mouthfeel, with higher levels potentially causing a salty taste.\n",
        "Free Sulfur Dioxide: Sulfur dioxide is used as a preservative and antioxidant in wine.\n",
        "Total Sulfur Dioxide: Total sulfur dioxide includes free and bound sulfur dioxide and affects wine preservation.\n",
        "Density: Density is related to the concentration of substances in wine and can influence mouthfeel.\n",
        "pH: pH levels impact the wine's acidity and stability.\n",
        "Sulphates: Sulphates can act as antioxidants and antimicrobial agents.\n",
        "Alcohol: Alcohol content can significantly impact the perception of wine's body and flavor.\n",

        "\n",
        "Common techniques for handling missing data in this dataset include mean imputation (replacing missing values with the mean of the feature), median imputation (replacing with the median), and using machine learning models to predict missing values.\n",
        "Advantages: Mean and median imputation are simple and quick. Predictive models can capture relationships between variables.\n",
