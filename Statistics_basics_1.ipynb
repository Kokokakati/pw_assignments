It provides a measure of the central value that is not affected by extreme observations, making it useful when the dataset is skewed or contains outliers.\n",

A higher variance indicates greater variability or spread of the data points. The variance is useful for understanding the degree of scatter or dispersion in the dataset.\n",

It is particularly useful for datasets that follow a normal distribution.\n",
