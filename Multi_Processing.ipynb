        "\n",
        "Nature: In multiprocessing, multiple processes are created, each with its own memory space and resources, while in multithreading, multiple threads are created within a single process, sharing the same memory space and resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrency: Processes in multiprocessing can run in parallel on different CPU cores or processors, enabling true parallel execution. Threads in multithreading, on the other hand, run concurrently within a single process, sharing the CPU time allocated by the operating system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Isolation: Processes in multiprocessing are isolated from each other, with separate memory spaces. This provides better data protection and avoids issues like race conditions. In multithreading, threads share the same memory space, making data sharing and synchronization more challenging and prone to issues like race conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overhead: Creating and managing processes in multiprocessing typically incurs higher overhead compared to creating and managing threads in multithreading. Processes require more system resources, such as memory and time, for setup and communication.\n",
        "\n",
        "Communication: Processes in multiprocessing communicate through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory. Threads in multithreading can communicate more easily through shared variables or data structures."
