        "Label Encoding: It involves assigning a unique integer to each category in a categorical variable. For example, if you have categories like \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" label encoding would assign them integer values like 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
        "Ordinal Encoding: This encoding is specifically used when the categorical variable has an inherent order or hierarchy. It assigns integer values to categories based on their order. For instance, if you have categories like \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high,\" ordinal encoding might assign them values like 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
        "Example: Suppose you have a dataset with a categorical variable \"Temperature\" with categories \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High.\" If the temperature scale has a natural order, such as low < medium < high, you would use ordinal encoding to preserve this order. If the categories were simply labels without any inherent order, you might use label encoding instead.\n",

        "For instance, you might calculate the mean of the target variable for each category, then rank the categories based on these means and assign ordinal values accordingly.\n",
