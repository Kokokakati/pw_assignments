        "Q1. The curse of dimensionality refers to the challenges and issues that arise when dealing with high-dimensional data in machine learning and other data analysis tasks. It's important in machine learning because high-dimensional data can lead to increased computational complexity, decreased model performance, and difficulties in interpreting and visualizing the data.\n",

        "Q2. The curse of dimensionality impacts the performance of machine learning algorithms in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "Increased computational complexity: As the number of dimensions increases, algorithms require more time and resources to process the data.\n",
        "Increased risk of overfitting: With high-dimensional data, models are more likely to fit noise in the data rather than true patterns, leading to poor generalization.\n",

        "\n",
        "Increased risk of overfitting: High-dimensional data can lead to overfit models that perform well on training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
        "Reduced sample density: In high-dimensional spaces, data points become more sparse, making it harder to estimate meaningful relationships.\n",
        "Increased computational cost: Algorithms become computationally expensive as the number of dimensions grows, which can be impractical for large datasets.\n",

In high-dimensional spaces, models are more likely to overfit because they can find spurious patterns in the data. Conversely, if the dimensionality is not reduced appropriately, models may underfit because they struggle to capture meaningful patterns.\n",
