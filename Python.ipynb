        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal state of an object and restricting access to it, ensuring data integrity and security.\n",
        "\n",

        "Inheritance: Mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behavior (attributes and methods) from another class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship among classes, where derived classes (subclasses) inherit from base classes (superclasses).\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors based on the context. It allows a single interface to be used for different data types or objects, enabling flexibility and simplifying code maintenance."

This function allows us to ensure that certain attributes are set to specific values when an object is instantiated.\n",
