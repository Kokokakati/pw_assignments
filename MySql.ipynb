        "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed to provide efficient access and retrieval. It stores information in tables (or collections), each consisting of rows (or documents) and columns (or fields).\n",
        "SQL databases: Also known as relational databases, SQL databases store data in structured tables with a predefined schema. They follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties and use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.\n",
        "NoSQL databases: NoSQL databases, also known as non-relational or distributed databases, store data in flexible, schema-less formats, such as key-value pairs, document stores, column-family stores, or graph databases. They are designed for horizontal scalability and are often used for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB."
