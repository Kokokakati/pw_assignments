It ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better cluster separation. A value near 1 indicates good clustering, 0 indicates overlapping clusters, and negative values suggest that data points may be assigned to the wrong clusters.\n",

For example, in a document clustering task where documents are grouped by topics, if one cluster contains all documents about \"sports,\" it has high homogeneity because it consists entirely of documents on the same topic.

The Silhouette Coefficient can be used to compare the quality of different clustering algorithms on the same dataset by computing the Silhouette Coefficient for each algorithm and comparing the scores.

It assumes that clusters should be well-separated from each other, and within each cluster, data points should be close to each other.
