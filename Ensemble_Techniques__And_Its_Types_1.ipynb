Instead of relying on a single model, ensemble methods leverage the diversity of multiple models to improve overall performance and generalization.\n",

        "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique where multiple models are trained independently on different random subsets of the training data. The subsets are created by sampling with replacement (bootstrap sampling). After training, the predictions from each model are combined through averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification) to make the final prediction.\n",

Boosting assigns weights to training instances, giving more emphasis to misclassified instances, allowing the model to improve its performance gradually."
