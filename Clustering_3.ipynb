        "Q2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm. Unlike K-means and hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN doesn't require specifying the number of clusters beforehand and can discover clusters of arbitrary shapes. It identifies clusters as dense regions separated by areas of lower point density.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. To determine the optimal values for epsilon (the radius of the neighborhood) and the minimum points parameter in DBSCAN, you can use techniques like the \"Elbow Method\" or the \"Knee Method\" applied to the distance distribution of data points. Experiment with different values and observe the effect on cluster formation and noise points.\n",

        "Q6. Yes, DBSCAN can be applied to datasets with high-dimensional feature spaces. However, in high-dimensional spaces, the \"curse of dimensionality\" can make distance-based metrics less effective. It's essential to preprocess the data by reducing dimensionality or selecting appropriate distance metrics to mitigate this challenge.\n",

Implementing DBSCAN in Python and applying it to a sample dataset involves several steps, including importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, setting parameters (epsilon and minimum points), fitting the DBSCAN model, and visualizing the clusters. Due to the complexity of code and data, it's best to provide code for specific examples or datasets. If you have a particular dataset in mind, please provide it, and I can help you with a code example and interpretation of the results."
